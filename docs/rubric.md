rushing the rubric looks like this: Technical (50%) – non-trivial engineering: real backend/infra, good prompting/RAG/agents, handling edge cases, and a working, reliable demo (even if scoped). Impact (20%) – a very specific, real student pain with clear before/after: who you help, how often it hurts today, and how your thing measurably makes their life better. Product (10%) – focused UX and story: one primary flow, easy to understand in under a minute, and a 5‑minute demo that feels like a product, not a science fair. Use of AI (10%) – AI is doing something meaningfully smart (not just “we added a chatbot”), with the model choice/prompting/flow clearly thought through. Ethics (10%) – you’ve explicitly thought about failure modes (hallucinations, bad advice, privacy, over-dependence), show concrete mitigations in the design, and are honest about what your AI should not be trusted with.
