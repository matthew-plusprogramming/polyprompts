Final polish fixes:
- Try and get their name from resume. If we can't detect or whatever 
just act as we currently do. If we can however, make sure to address the
candidate by name in the interview for the questions.
- Make sure 1 question from job desc, and 1 question from resume. It seemed
like both questions were from the resume
- Be mindful of potential NDA covered questions if we're asking about a previous
experience. So make sure the question is mindful of that when we're basing
our question on the prev experience.
- For when we do ask the job desc based question. We want the prefix to be like
"at our company, we do xyz" and then asking the question. So like to provide
context. Don't make up a company name if we don't have it just be general with
at our company
