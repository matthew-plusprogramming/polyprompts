Final polish fixes:
- Confidence scores I thought were showing up under the overall score on the feedback screen. Please 
ensure that is there.
- Please center justify all of the text around "Overall" section including the overall text and the
score percent.
- Our company (fix the wording). One of the questions was like "at our company, what experience
have you had doing xyz." Like it should be "at are company we do xyz, what experience have you had 
doing xyz thing that is similar." If that makes sense. 
- We want to be able to press a key mid guided review to stop it (for demo purposes)
