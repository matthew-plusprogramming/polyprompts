## 1. Aesthetic-Usability Effect

Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable.

**Key Takeaways:**
- An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people's brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better.
- People are more forgiving of minor usability problems when a product or service has visually appealing design.
- Visually pleasing design can obscure usability problems and prevent issues from being discovered during usability testing.

**Origin:** First studied in 1995 by Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura at the Hitachi Design Center. They tested 26 variations of an ATM UI with 252 participants and found that users are strongly influenced by aesthetics even when evaluating underlying functionality.

---

## 2. Choice Overload

People become overwhelmed when presented with a large number of options.

**Key Takeaways:**
- An abundance of options can impair users' ability to make decisions and diminish their perception of the overall experience.
- When users must evaluate options, facilitate side-by-side comparisons of related items to reduce cognitive load.
- Prevent overwhelm by strategically managing what information users see at each moment. Use techniques like featuring key products, search functionality, and filtering tools.

**Origin:** The concept of overchoice was introduced by Alvin Toffler in his 1970 publication, *Future Shock*.

---

## 3. Chunking

A process by which individual pieces of information are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Chunking helps users quickly identify and locate information relevant to their objectives, enabling faster information processing.
- Organizing content into visually distinct, hierarchical groups aligns digital information with how users naturally evaluate and process content.
- Designers can use chunking to clarify underlying connections by creating distinctive content modules, applying separation rules, and establishing clear hierarchy.

**Origin:** Derived from George A. Miller's landmark 1956 paper, "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information."

---

## 4. Cognitive Bias

A systematic error in thinking and judgment that shapes how we perceive the world and make decisions.

**Key Takeaways:**
- People rely on rules of thumb derived from prior experiences to make rapid decisions without exhaustive analysis. While this improves efficiency, these shortcuts can unconsciously influence judgment.
- Recognizing our own inherent biases may not eliminate them entirely, but it helps identify them in ourselves and others, protecting against flawed reasoning and costly errors.
- Confirmation bias: People tend to seek out, interpret, and recall information confirming their existing beliefs.

**Origin:** Introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1972 after observing people's difficulty reasoning intuitively with large numerical magnitudes. They demonstrated through replicable experiments that human judgment diverges from rational choice theory.

---

## 5. Cognitive Load

The mental resources required for users to comprehend and interact with an interface.

**Key Takeaways:**
- When data input surpasses our cognitive processing space, users experience mental strain, miss important details, and feel overwhelmed by tasks.
- **Intrinsic cognitive load:** The mental effort users expend to retain goal-relevant information, assimilate new content, and maintain focus on their objectives.
- **Extraneous cognitive load:** Unnecessary mental processing that consumes cognitive resources without advancing user comprehension, typically caused by distracting or superfluous design elements.

**Origin:** Emerged during the late 1980s through psychologist John Sweller's investigation of problem-solving processes, building upon George Miller's information processing theories. His foundational 1988 work "Cognitive Load Theory, Learning Difficulty, and Instructional Design" established the framework.

---

## 6. Doherty Threshold

Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Maintain system feedback within 400ms to sustain attention and boost productivity.
- Leverage perceived performance strategies to minimize the feeling of waiting.
- Employ animation to maintain engagement during background processing.
- Use progress indicators to make delays feel more manageable.
- Strategic delays can paradoxically enhance perceived quality and user confidence.

**Origin:** In 1982, Walter J. Doherty and Ahrvind J. Thadani published findings in the IBM Systems Journal establishing 400 milliseconds as the response-time threshold, a significant reduction from the previous 2-second standard.

---

## 7. Fitts's Law

The time required to acquire a target is determined by both the distance to it and its size.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Interactive elements should be sufficiently large to enable accurate user selection.
- Adequate distance between touch targets prevents accidental selection and improves precision.
- Position interactive controls in easily accessible areas of the interface to minimize acquisition time.

**Origin:** Psychologist Paul Fitts demonstrated in 1954 that the time required to move to a target depends on the distance to it, yet relates inversely to its size. This research on human motor control became foundational to UX/UI design.

---

## 8. Flow

The mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Flow emerges when task difficulty matches user capability, combining intense concentration with a sense of complete control.
- Tasks that are overly challenging breed frustration, while insufficiently demanding tasks create boredom. Calibrate challenge appropriately.
- Enable flow by delivering meaningful feedback so users understand what actions they've taken and what they've accomplished.
- Streamline efficiency by eliminating unnecessary obstacles and ensuring content and features are easily discoverable.

**Origin:** Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi introduced the concept of flow in 1975.

---

## 9. Goal-Gradient Effect

The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The closer users are to completing a task, the faster they work towards reaching it.
- Providing artificial progress towards a goal helps ensure users are more likely to have the motivation to complete that task.
- Provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete tasks.

**Origin:** The goal-gradient hypothesis was originally developed by behaviorist Clark Hull in 1932. His 1934 experiment demonstrated that rats accelerated their movement as they approached food.

---

## 10. Hick's Law

The time required to make a decision increases proportionally with the number and complexity of available choices.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Minimize choices during time-sensitive interactions to reduce decision latency.
- Decompose complex tasks into sequential, manageable steps to lower cognitive load.
- Guide user attention toward recommended options to prevent overwhelm.
- Implement gradual feature introduction for new users rather than full feature exposure.
- Balance simplicity with sufficient functionality to avoid over-abstraction.

**Origin:** Derived from 1952 research by British psychologist William Edmund Hick and American psychologist Ray Hyman. Their studies examined how the quantity of available stimuli affects reaction time.

---

## 11. Jakob's Law

Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Users apply expectations from familiar products to similar new ones, so consistency with industry standards improves usability.
- By adopting established conventions, designers reduce cognitive load and allow users to focus on tasks rather than learning new interaction patterns.
- When implementing changes, minimize user frustration by offering familiar versions alongside new designs, allowing adoption at the user's own pace.

**Origin:** Established by Jakob Nielsen, co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group and former VP of Research at Apple Computer.

---

## 12. Law of Common Region

Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they share an area with a clearly defined boundary.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Common region establishes clear structure, enabling users to quickly comprehend how elements and sections relate to one another.
- Borders around individual elements or groups represent a straightforward method for establishing common region.
- Background definition behind elements or groups similarly creates common region effects.

**Origin:** Stems from Gestalt psychology, which proposes that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns. The grouping principles fall into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.

---

## 13. Law of Proximity

Objects that are near or proximate to each other tend to be grouped together.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Proximity establishes relationships between nearby objects.
- Elements in close proximity are perceived as sharing similar functionality or traits.
- Proximity enables users to understand and organize information faster and more efficiently.

**Origin:** Derives from the Gestalt Laws of Grouping, proposed by early Gestalt psychologists to explain how humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns (Pragnanz).

---

## 14. Law of Pragnanz

People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it requires the least cognitive effort.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The human eye seeks simplicity and order within complex shapes to avoid information overload.
- People process and retain simple figures more effectively than complex ones.
- The eye simplifies intricate shapes by consolidating them into a single, cohesive form.

**Origin:** Max Wertheimer developed foundational insights in 1910 while observing flashing lights at a railroad crossing. Though the lights cycled sequentially, observers perceived a single light traveling around the sequence. This led Wertheimer to formulate principles explaining visual perception that became fundamental to graphic design.

---

## 15. Law of Similarity

The human eye tends to perceive similar elements as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Elements sharing similar visual properties are perceived as interconnected and belonging to the same category.
- Color, shape, size, orientation, and movement all communicate that components function together and convey related meaning.
- Links and navigation elements must be distinctly styled to set them apart from regular text and other content.

**Origin:** Derives from the Gestalt Laws of Grouping. The grouping principles fall into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.

---

## 16. Law of Uniform Connectedness

Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Group similar functions using visual connections like colors, lines, frames, or shapes.
- Create visual connections between elements using tangible references such as lines or arrows to show relationships.
- Apply uniform connectedness to demonstrate context and emphasize relationships among comparable items.

**Origin:** Stems from Gestalt psychology principles. Gestalt psychologists proposed that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns based on innate mental dispositions.

---

## 17. Mental Model

A compressed psychological framework representing what people believe they understand about how a system operates.

**Key Takeaways:**
- People develop working assumptions about systems and apply them to analogous situations.
- Products succeed when their design matches user expectations, enabling knowledge transfer across experiences.
- E-commerce sites leverage established conventions (product cards, shopping carts, checkout sequences) that align with shopper expectations.
- Teams reduce misalignment between designer assumptions and actual user mental models through interviews, personas, journey mapping, and empathy mapping.

**Origin:** Psychologist Kenneth Craik introduced the concept in *The Nature of Explanation* (1943). He proposed that people maintain internal "small-scale models" of the world to anticipate events, reason through problems, and construct explanations.

---

## 18. Miller's Law

The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Avoid using the "magical number seven" as justification for unnecessary design restrictions.
- Break content into smaller, manageable chunks to enhance user comprehension and memory retention.
- Recognize that working memory capacity varies among individuals based on their existing knowledge and context.

**Origin:** In 1956, George Miller proposed that both immediate memory span and absolute judgment were limited to approximately 7 units of information. He defined information in "bits" -- the data needed to choose between two equally likely options.

---

## 19. Occam's Razor

Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The most effective approach to managing complexity is preventing it from the outset.
- Systematically evaluate each component and eliminate unnecessary elements while preserving functionality.
- Design reaches maturity only when nothing further can be removed without degrading performance.

**Origin:** Stems from the Latin principle "lex parsimoniae" (law of parsimony), developed by William of Ockham (c. 1287-1347), an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher.

---

## 20. Paradox of the Active User

Users never read manuals but start using the software immediately.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Users are driven by completing their current objectives and typically avoid spending time on upfront documentation or tutorials.
- While learning thoroughly would save time eventually, users still choose immediate action over preparation, even when it leads to errors.
- Embed helpful guidance directly within the product experience through contextual elements like tooltips and in-app assistance.

**Origin:** Introduced by Mary Beth Rosson and John Carroll in 1987 through their research on human-computer interaction, specifically in "Interfacing thought: cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction."

---

## 21. Pareto Principle

Roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Inputs and outputs are often not evenly distributed.
- A large group may contain only a few meaningful contributors to the desired outcome.
- Focus the majority of effort on the areas that will bring the largest benefits to the most users.

**Origin:** Originates from economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population.

---

## 22. Parkinson's Law

Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Cap task completion timeframes based on user expectations to prevent unnecessary delays.
- Shortening the actual time needed below expected duration enhances user experience significantly.
- Implement autofill and similar efficiency features in forms to accelerate critical information entry.

**Origin:** Cyril Northcote Parkinson introduced this concept in a satirical essay published in The Economist in 1955. It was later compiled in his 1958 book *Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress*.

---

## 23. Peak-End Rule

People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Concentrate on designing the most emotionally significant points and the conclusion of user interactions.
- Identify opportunities where your product delivers maximum value, utility, or enjoyment, and intentionally enhance these moments.
- Users retain unfavorable experiences with greater intensity than positive ones, making mitigation essential.

**Origin:** Gained scientific validation through a landmark 1993 study by Daniel Kahneman and colleagues. Participants preferred a longer, slightly less uncomfortable experience over a shorter but equally intense one, demonstrating that retrospective judgments prioritize memorable endpoints over total duration.

---

## 24. Postel's Law

Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Demonstrate flexibility and tolerance toward the diverse actions and inputs users may provide.
- Plan for a wide range of user input, access methods, and capabilities while maintaining interface reliability and accessibility.
- Accept variable user input, translate it to meet system requirements, establish clear boundaries, and deliver transparent feedback.

**Origin:** Formulated by Jon Postel for TCP network implementations. Programs sending messages should conform completely to specifications, but programs receiving messages should accept non-conformant input as long as the meaning is clear.

---

## 25. Selective Attention

The cognitive process of focusing on a specific subset of environmental stimuli while filtering out irrelevant information.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Users naturally filter out irrelevant information to maintain focus. Guide attention strategically and prevent cognitive overwhelm.
- **Banner blindness:** Users consciously or unconsciously ignore banner-like content. Avoid styling regular content to resemble advertisements.
- **Change blindness:** Significant interface changes may go unnoticed due to attentional limitations. Audit layouts for simultaneous competing changes.

**Origin:** Emerged mid-20th century through several foundational contributions: Donald Broadbent's Filter Theory (1958), E. Colin Cherry's Cocktail Party Effect (1953), Anne Treisman's Attenuation Model (1960), and the Deutsch & Deutsch Late Selection Theory (1963).

---

## 26. Serial Position Effect

Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Items positioned in the middle of lists are typically retained less frequently in both working and long-term memory.
- Placing primary actions at the far left and right edges of interface elements like navigation menus can enhance user retention and recognition.

**Origin:** Named by Hermann Ebbinghaus. Two related concepts define this principle: the **Primacy Effect** (items at the beginning are recalled with greater accuracy) and the **Recency Effect** (items at the end are recalled with greater accuracy).

---

## 27. Tesler's Law

Also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity: every system contains an irreducible core of complexity that cannot be eliminated -- it can only be shifted between the system and its users.

**Key Takeaways:**
- All processes contain fundamental complexity that cannot be designed away; it must be managed by either the system or the user.
- Designers should shoulder as much of the inherent complexity as feasible during design and development phases.
- Products should account for actual human behavior rather than assuming idealized, rational decision-making patterns.
- Provide accessible guidance embedded within the usage context, such as tooltips and helpful information.

**Origin:** Larry Tesler, while at Xerox PARC during the mid-1980s, recognized that user interaction methods were as vital as applications themselves. His key argument: an engineer should spend an extra week reducing application complexity versus making millions of users spend an extra minute.

---

## 28. Von Restorff Effect

Also known as The Isolation Effect: when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Make important information or key actions visually distinctive.
- Use restraint when placing emphasis on visual elements to avoid them competing with one another and to ensure salient items don't get mistakenly identified as ads.
- Don't exclude those with a color vision deficiency or low vision by relying exclusively on color to communicate contrast.
- Carefully consider users with motion sensitivity when using motion to communicate contrast.

**Origin:** Developed by German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hedwig von Restorff (1906-1962). In her 1933 research, she found that memory retention improved significantly for items that stood out from a list of categorically similar items.

---

## 29. Working Memory

A cognitive system that temporarily holds and manipulates information needed to complete tasks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Working memory can retain only 4-7 chunks of information at any moment, with each chunk fading within 20-30 seconds. Display only necessary and relevant information.
- The brain excels at recognizing previously encountered information but struggles with retaining new data for immediate use. Support this by visually marking viewed content and providing breadcrumb navigation.
- Reduce cognitive burden on users by having the system retain critical information across screens (e.g., comparison tables).

**Origin:** The term emerged in the 1960s through George A. Miller, Eugene Galanter, and Karl H. Pribram's research comparing the mind to a computer. Richard C. Atkinson and Richard M. Shiffrin formalized it in 1968 to describe their "short-term store" model.

---

## 30. Zeigarnik Effect

People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use clear visual indicators to signal additional available content, encouraging users to explore further.
- Showing artificial or real progress toward a goal increases user likelihood of task completion through sustained motivation.
- Displaying transparent progress tracking helps maintain user drive to finish initiated tasks.

**Origin:** Bluma Wulfovna Zeigarnik (1900-1988), a Soviet psychologist, conducted memory research in the 1920s comparing recall between incomplete and complete tasks. She discovered that incomplete tasks were easier to remember than successful ones. She received the Lewin Memorial Award in 1983 for her contributions.
